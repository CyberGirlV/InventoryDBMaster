# InventoryDBMaster
Inventory Data Base using MySQL Workbench

During the SQL development practice, IÂ´ve created a relational-single table that will store relative information for an Inventory classified by Regions.
Data Type Definition:
ORDERDATE
          As data value, this will store the data where the inventory item was received.
REGION
          As a string value, this will store the name of the regions.
REP
          As a string value, this will store the name of the representative person for the region.
ITEM
          As a string value, this will store the name of the item received. 
UNITS
          As an integer value, this will store the count of each item received.
UNITCOST
          As an integer value, this will store the value in the US dollar of each item cost received.
TOTAL
          As an integer value, this will store the total value in the US dollar of each item cost received.

This database can be used to reference other inventory data in different complex ways to integrate the needs of the business.
